# MapView II

based on the original MapView by Ben Ratzlaff, but reworked from top to bottom (almost)

Compiled .exe(s) and .dll(s) and a CHM helpfile are in the Distribution folder. I have only a Windows7 64-bit machine, but those builds should run as 64-bit on 64-bit machines or 32-bit on 32-bit machines.

.NET 3.5 is required.
